Every day, huge amounts of new scientific manuscripts are published. On the pre-print service arxiv.org alone, more than x papers where uploaded last year. This flood of scientific manuscripts is impossible to filter, index and organize manually. Hence scientist rely heavily on existing search engines like Google Scholar or Mendeley to find relevant content, mainly by using keyword search.

Keyword search is tricky, because similar concepts are referred to using different terminology between disciplines or even between subfields. For instance in the machine learning community we talk about features and labels, wheres statisticians usually refer to the same concepts as independent and dependent variables.

Instead, we propose to organize publications not by their plain-text content, but by the equations used to describe their respective ideas. This way we hope to find connections between fields that do not share a common vocabulary. Examples could include connections between probabilistic graphical models used in artificial intelligence and models of non-standard physics.
